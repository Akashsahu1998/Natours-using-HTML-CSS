    We want to use the 10px but as we are setting it into the root so user can't able to change the size from the browser sertting, 
    so we can't restrct user from changing it, so we can set it to percentage, the default size is 16px and if we are giving 100%,
    then it will take completly 16px but we want here 10px wo we will take the division like 10/16 so we get 62.5% so we are going to use this.
    [(10*100)/16] = 62.5.
    1 rem = 10px;
